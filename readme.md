## 🔹 Professional Testing Coverage

| Test Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ **System Testing** | End-to-end workflow: Normal User → Admin → Delivery Man. Ensures all modules work together. |
| ✅ **Acceptance Testing** | Verifies system meets business requirements and user stories. |
| ✅ **Unit Testing** | Tests individual functions, forms, buttons, and APIs in isolation. |
| ✅ **Integration Testing** | Validates interactions between modules, e.g., Admin assigning delivery man → User parcel status updated. |
| ✅ **Regression Testing** | Ensures new changes do not break existing workflows. |
| ✅ **Search & Filter Testing** | Tests parcel search, filtering, sorting for accuracy and edge cases. |
| ✅ **Add-to-Cart / Parcel Assignment Testing** | Ensures correct parcels are assigned and updated. |
| ✅ **Toast / Notification Handling** | Validates UI messages appear and disappear correctly. |
| ✅ **UI / Responsive Testing** | Checks mobile/desktop layouts, buttons, forms, and accessibility. |
| ✅ **Form Validation & Negative Testing** | Invalid inputs, empty fields, duplicate entries. |
| ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Testing** | Verifies that users, delivery men, and admin cannot access unauthorized pages or actions. |
| ✅ **Security Testing** | Basic security checks, unauthorized access attempts, and data privacy validation. |
| ✅ **Performance / Load Testing** | Measures response time, delays, and concurrent user simulation. |
| ✅ **Cross-Browser Testing** | Verifies functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Edge (if extended). |
| ✅ **API / Backend Testing** | Validates key endpoints (parcel creation, status updates) respond correctly. |
| ✅ **Logging & Reporting** | Captures test logs, errors, and screenshots for review. |
| ✅ **Accessibility Testing** | Verifies buttons, forms, and notifications are accessible to all users. |
